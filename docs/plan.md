# Architecture Overview

## Core Structure

- Main client class (similar to Stripe's new Stripe())
- Resource-based organization (payments, customers, subscriptions, etc.)
- Method chaining and intuitive naming
- TypeScript support with strong typing
- Built-in error handling and retries

## Key Components to Build

1. Core Client

- Authentication handling (API keys, tokens)
- Base HTTP client with retry logic
- Request/response interceptors
- Environment configuration (sandbox/production)

2. Resource Classes

- Each API endpoint group becomes a resource (e.g., client.payments.create())
- CRUD operations with consistent naming
- Pagination handling
- Webhooks support

3. Developer Experience Features

- Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- Detailed JSDoc documentation
- Request/response logging (debug mode)
- Idempotency key support
- Rate limiting handling

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Set up project structure with TypeScript
- Create base HTTP client
- Implement authentication
- Add basic error handling

### Phase 2: Core Resources

- Build your most important resources first
- Implement CRUD operations
- Add validation and error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Webhooks handling
- Pagination utilities
- Request retries and timeouts
- File uploads (if needed)

### Phase 4: Developer Tools

- Testing utilities
- Documentation and examples
